Optionally an SMS with your name will be sent to the new contact.\r\n\r\n**3.** Add a new contact directly from an SMS message containing that contacts name. \r\n\r\n###Add Contact IS \r\nmeant to make it fast to add new contacts and easy to access them right away. If you want to add mobile numbers of new friends (or enemies) more quickly or see your most recently added contacts, this is the app for you. \r\n\r\n###Add Contact IS NOT \r\na dedicated contact manager. If you want a manager that allows you to input a number, email, business, address etc all at once, this is not the app for you. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=add.contact\">\r\n  <img alt=\"Android app on Google Play\"\r\n       src=\"https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_60.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
